    return `Season context (FRC 2026: REBUILT, official manual-aligned summary):
- Core objective: score FUEL in your HUB, manage active/inactive HUB windows during TELEOP, and climb the TOWER for endgame value.
- MATCH flow: AUTO (20s), then TELEOP (2:20) with TRANSITION SHIFT (10s), SHIFT 1-4 (25s each), then END GAME (30s).
- HUB logic: both HUBS are active in AUTO, TRANSITION SHIFT, and END GAME. During SHIFT 1-4, one HUB is active and the other inactive (driven by AUTO FUEL result).
- 2026 scoring highlights: active HUB FUEL = 1 point (AUTO and TELEOP), inactive HUB FUEL = 0 points. TOWER points: LEVEL 1 = 15 (AUTO) / 10 (TELEOP), LEVEL 2 = 20 (TELEOP), LEVEL 3 = 30 (TELEOP).
- 2026 RP framework: ENERGIZED RP (100 active HUB FUEL at Regional/District events; 140 at District Championship/Championship), SUPERCHARGED RP (360 active HUB FUEL at Regional/District events; 510 at District Championship/Championship), TRAVERSAL RP (50 TOWER points at Regional/District events; 70 at District Championship/Championship).

Terminology rules:
- Use official 2026 terms when applicable: FUEL, HUB (active/inactive), TRANSITION SHIFT, SHIFT 1-4, END GAME, TOWER LEVEL 1/2/3, BUMP, TRENCH, DEPOT, OUTPOST, CHUTE.
- Do not introduce non-manual terms or aliases (for example, avoid "bump lane" or "trench lane" if not present in the source data).

Reliability guardrails:
- Do not invent mechanics, point values, RP thresholds, or game-state transitions beyond this summary and the provided input data.
- If team-specific evidence is limited, use neutral phrasing like "auto scoring output", "teleop throughput", "hub-window management", and "endgame climb reliability".
- Keep wording practical and drive-team ready; no hype.`;

  if (year === 2025) {
    return `Season context (FRC 2025: REEFSCAPE, official manual-aligned summary):
- Core objective: score CORAL on the REEF (L1-L4), score ALGAE in PROCESSOR/NET, and finish with PARK/CAGE outcomes at the BARGE.
- MATCH flow: AUTO (15s), then TELEOP (2:15).
- 2025 scoring highlights: LEAVE = 3 (AUTO). CORAL points by REEF level: L1 = 3/2 (AUTO/TELEOP), L2 = 4/3, L3 = 6/4, L4 = 7/5. ALGAE: PROCESSOR = 6, NET = 4. BARGE: PARK = 2, shallow CAGE = 6, deep CAGE = 12 (TELEOP values).
- Coopertition interaction: in Qualification MATCHES, if each alliance scores at least 2 ALGAE in its PROCESSOR, all teams receive 1 Coopertition Point and the CORAL RP requirement is reduced.
- 2025 RP framework: AUTO RP (all non-bypassed robots LEAVE + at least 1 CORAL in AUTO), CORAL RP (at least 7 CORAL on each REEF level; reduced to any 3 levels if Coopertition criteria are met), and BARGE RP (at least 16 BARGE points). District Championship/Championship RP thresholds may be higher.

Terminology rules:
- Use official 2025 terms when applicable: CORAL, ALGAE, REEF, PROCESSOR, NET, BARGE, CORAL STATION, PARK, shallow CAGE, deep CAGE, Coopertition Point.

Reliability guardrails:
- Do not invent game actions, point values, or ranking-point logic beyond this summary and the provided input data.
- If team-specific evidence is limited, use neutral phrasing like "game-piece throughput", "scoring consistency", and "endgame reliability".
- Keep wording practical and drive-team ready; no hype.`;
